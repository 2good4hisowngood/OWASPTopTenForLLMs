# OWASPTopTenForLLMs
A presentation I created for my local ISSA chapter, and presented on to HungerRush. 

Covering Large Language Models, Agents, and Multi-Agent Orchestration systems, to give a view of current trends in the space, as well as security considerations for systems using these technologies.
